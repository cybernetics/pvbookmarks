Introduction
============

Bower is a package manager for the web. 

It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package 
management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be 
consumed by a more opinionated build stack. 

There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between 
different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.

Bower runs over Git, and is package-agnostic. 

A packaged component can be made up of any type of asset, and use any type of 
transport
