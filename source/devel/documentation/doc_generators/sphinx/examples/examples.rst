I have heard a few times over the past couple months that Sphinx is “mainly for 
Python projects”. This line of thinking makes sense, because Sphinx was created 
to document Python itself. Sphinx however, is a generic documentation tool that 
is capable of documenting any software project.

The goal of Sphinx is to help you write prose documentation. Prose docs work 
great for any kind of software you are documenting.

What it doesn’t handle particularly well is generation of docs from source code. 

This is a task that is best left to a language-specific tooling, so I don’t see 
this as a major downside of Sphinx.
