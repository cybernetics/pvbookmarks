TextTest is an open source tool for text-based functional testing. This means 
running a program in lots of different ways from the command line, and using 
the text output produced as a means of controlling the behaviour of that 
application.

Also on this site are StoryText and CaptureMock, which aid in GUI testing and 
mocking respectively. They do not depend on TextTest in any way but are well 
suited to being used together with it.
