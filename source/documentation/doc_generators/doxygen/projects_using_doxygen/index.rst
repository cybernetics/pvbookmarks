Introduction
============

Doxygen supports a number of `output formats`_ where HTML is the most popular one.
I've gathered some `nice examples`_ of real-life projects using doxygen.

These are part of a larger `list of projects`_ that use doxygen. If you know other
projects, let me know and I'll add them.
