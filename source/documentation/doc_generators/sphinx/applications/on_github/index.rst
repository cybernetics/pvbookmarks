This project is designed to help you get around the github-pages Jekyll behaviour
of ignoring top level directories starting with an underscore.

This is solved in a much neater way by creating a .nojekyll in the root of you
github-pages which will disable Jekyll as described here and here.

This makes this project largely useless!

Thank you to acdha for making me aware of this.
