Georg Brandl and Brett Cannon to Receive PSF Community Awards (Thursday, August 07, 2008)
=========================================================================================

At the July Board meeting of the PSF Board of Directors, PSF Community Awards
were awarded to Georg Brandl and Brett Cannon.

Georg has been an enthusiastic contributor to the core for several years, and a
while ago stunned the Python development world by building the :ref:`Sphinx <sphinx>`
documentation system as an alternative to the LaTeX-based system we had been
using previously, and converting the Python documentation to use it.

Brett has also been an active core developer for many years, but was nominated
for his infrastructure work in migrating the Python bug-tracking system off of
SourceForge to our own Roundup instance, and for his efforts keeping the Python
developer introduction updated.

Georg and Brett richly deserve recognition for their contributions.

Congratulations to Brett and Georg, and thanks for all your hard work!
