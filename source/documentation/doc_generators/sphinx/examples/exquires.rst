Introduction
============

The EXQUIRES test suite (hereby referred to as EXQUIRES) is an open source
framework for assessing the accuracy of image upsampling methods.

EXQUIRES can also be used to compare image difference metrics, or to measure the
impact of various factors, including test image selection and properties,
downsampler choice, resizing ratio, etc.
