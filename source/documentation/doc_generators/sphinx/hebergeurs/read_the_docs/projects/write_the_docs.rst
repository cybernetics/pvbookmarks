Introduction
============

Write the Docs is a place where the art and science of documentation can 
be practiced and appreciated. 

There are a lot of people out there that write docs, but there isn't a 
good place to go to find information, ask questions, and generally be a 
member of a community of documentarians. 

We hope to slowly solve this problem by building a place with high 
quality information about the art of writing documentation. 

Along with that, we hope to open communication between all the awesome 
people out there writing documentation.
