Source encoding
===============

Since the easiest way to include special characters like em dashes or copyright
signs in reST is to directly write them as Unicode characters, one has to
specify an encoding:

All Python documentation source files must be in UTF-8 encoding, and the HTML
documents written from them will be in that encoding as well.
