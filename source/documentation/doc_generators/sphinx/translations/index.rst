    objet:   [sphinx-users] Re: Call for translation updates - Now on transifex


Hi,

since editing raw .po files is not a good workflow for everyone, I registered
Sphinx on Transifex:

   https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/sphinx-1/

If you want to translate/update to your language there, please drop me an
email and I will add you to the corresponding language group.

cheers,
Georg
