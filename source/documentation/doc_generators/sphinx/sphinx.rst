Description
============

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful 
documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.

It was originally created for the new Python documentation, and it has excellent 
facilities for the documentation of Python projects, but C/C++ is already 
supported as well, and it is planned to add special support for other languages 
as well.
