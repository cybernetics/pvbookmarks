Description
===========

This is an extension to restructured text and Sphinx to be able to read and
render the Doxygen xml output.

**It is an easy way to include Doxygen information in a set of documentation
generated by Sphinx**.

The aim is to produce an autodoc like support for people who enjoy using Sphinx
but work with languages other than Python.
The system relies on the Doxygenâ€™s xml output.
