The greatest piece of software in the world is useless without great 
documentation, but unfortunately most of us just don't write great docs. 

This can be fixed, though. 

Documentation doesn't need to be an afterthought, and doesn't have to be 
bad, and you, too, can learn how to write good docs and make that an 
integrated part of your development process.

care about documentation" sense and the "how to write things people will 
read" sense.
