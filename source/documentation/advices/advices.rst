The number one cause of startup failure is not the product, but the distribution: 
it doesn't matter how good the product is if no one uses it. 

With software, the documentation is the distribution: it doesn't matter how good 
the code is if no one uses it. If it isn't documented, it doesn't exist.

Docness

Consider the documentation as a component of your product, i.e. don’t 
package it as an external product or as an option.

In software development, your “product” is usually made of the software, 
which itself is usually based on source code.

In the beginning, there was no documentation. 

These days, infrastructure software has terrible documentation. 

**Take heed of these commandments, for, among hackers, judgment day is 
every day**.

==================================

Ideally, an agile document is just barely good enough, or just barely sufficient, 
for the situation at hand. 

Documentation is an important part of agile software development projects, but 
unlike traditionalists who often see documentation as a risk reduction strategy, 
agilists typically see documentation as a strategy which increases overall 
project risk and therefore strive to be as efficient as possible when it comes 
to documentation. 

Agilists write documentation when that's the best way to achieve the relevant 
goals, but there often proves to be better ways to achieve those goals than 
writing **static documentation**. 

This article summarizes common "best practices" which agilists have adopted 
with respect to documentation.

Best practices for increasing the agility of documentation:

Writing
    Prefer executable specifications over static documents
    Document stable concepts, not speculative ideas
    Generate system documentation
    
Simplification
    Keep documentation just simple enough, but not too simple
    Write the fewest documents with least overlap
    Put the information in the most appropriate place
    Display information publicly
    
Determining What to Document
    Document with a purpose
    Focus on the needs of the actual customers(s) of the document
    The customer determines sufficiency
    
Determining When to Document
    Iterate, iterate, iterate
    Find better ways to communicate
    Start with models you actually keep current
    Update only when it hurts
    
General
    Treat documentation like a requirement
    Require people to justify documentation requests
    Recognize that you need some documentation
    Get someone with writing experience
