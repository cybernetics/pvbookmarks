    Hey all,

    Looks like I am going to be giving a beginners presentation about writing 
    docs at the PDX Python user group. 
    I am adding a resource section that will list good places to go to look for 
    information about writing docs. My current list contains:

    * http://producingoss.com/en/getting-started.html
    * http://docs.writethedocs.org/

    What are some other good documentation resources that I might be missing ? 
    I hope to add all of the content from this talk back into docs.writethedocs.org, 
    so that it will live on.


My perspective comes from being a technical writer encouraging other technical 
writers to contribute to open source projects. 

I coordinate the OpenStack documentation through collaborative authoring, treating 
the docs like code with reviewed merges and bug logging, triaging, and so on. 
So my audience differs a bit from yours, but there are a lot of overlapping concepts.

For the audience of programmers you want to coach to write, I'd start with 
audience analysis and task analysis. 
I've attended a workshop Janet Swisher gave at the 2010 Google Summer of Code 
Doc Sprints where this approach was extremely effective. 

From http://justwriteclick.com/2011/10/21/google-summer-of-code-doc-summit-stories/

- Who is using your tool ?
- Why do they use your tool ?
- What kinds of things are they trying to do ?
- What can you assume they know ?
- What do they probably not know when they approach your tool ?

For the audience of writers you want to encourage to write for your project, 
I have a book with an Open Source Documentation chapter. http://justwriteclick.com/book/ 

It assumes a lot of pre-requisite knowledge such as audience and task analysis. 
I would definitely include slides about audience analysis and task analysis 
when coaching devs to write. 

Janet Swisher does the "encourage writers to write in the open" angle too, and 
has a great set of presentations at http://www.slideshare.net/janetswisher/. 
You can take anything from my presentations at http://slideshare.net/annegentle. 
I can send source if you want it. 
Janet and I co-presented about FLOSS Manuals at a Linux conference and the 
thesis there was partially "find communities of writers to work on your 
project's docs." That's a tactic as well.

Writers not only get distracted with a style guide, but also the 
writing/publishing/review tools. 
Using a third-party "referee" style guide for style questions is ideal 
(like Daniel Beck said). I'd coach "just put your butt in a seat and write" 
the tooling can be sorted out later. 

Discussing tools without focusing on the content can be a huge time waster, 
especially with devs. :) Encourage them to get info out of their brains. 

You probably know all this instinctively, so it's great to write it down 
and share !
