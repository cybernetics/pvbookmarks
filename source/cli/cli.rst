Introduction
============

A command-line interface (CLI) is a mechanism for interacting with a computer
operating system or software by typing commands to perform specific tasks.

The concept of the CLI originated when teletypewriter machines (TTY) were
connected to computers in the 1950s, and offered results on demand, compared to
batch oriented mechanical punched card input technology. Dedicated text-based
CRT terminals followed, with faster interaction and more information visible at
one time, then graphical terminals enriched the visual display of information.

Currently personal computers encapsulate all three functions (batch processing,
CLI, GUI) in software.


Usage
=====

A CLI is used whenever a large vocabulary of commands or queries, coupled with
a wide (or arbitrary) range of options, can be entered more rapidly as text than
with a pure GUI.
