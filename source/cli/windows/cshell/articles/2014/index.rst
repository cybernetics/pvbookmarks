Introduction
============

CShell, an interactive C# scripting environment providing real-time evaluation 
of code, is expected to have a formal 1.0 release in one to two months, having 
spent two years in development, says Lukas Buhler, developer of the project.

Leveraging both the Roslyn .Net compiler project and the Mono runtime, open 
source CShell provides a REPL (read-eval-print-loop) console-like environment. 

"Your code is directly evaluated and executed in a shell window; no separate 
executable has to be compiled and then run in a different process. 

More elaborate code can be written in a C# script and then evaluated as one file, 
only one line, or a selection," the project's webpage says. 

Buhler likens it to GitHub's recently released Atom code editor, albeit for C#.
