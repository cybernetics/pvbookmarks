If you haven’t seen the new Windows PowerShell version 3 yet, you should make a
point to check it out.

Don Jones

The new Windows PowerShell is coming. Actually, Microsoft has just launched a
Community Technology Preview (CTP) of `Windows PowerShell version 3`_, although the
final version 3 probably won’t ship until it comes out with Windows 8.

It also will be available for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. The CTP will
install on those OSes.

A CTP is an excellent point in the development cycle for you to start
experimenting with new Microsoft technology.

Product teams can still accept and act on feedback.

Don’t like some new piece  of syntax ? Say something.

Wish a feature did just one more useful thing ?  Let them know.

For Windows PowerShell, that feedback is usually best sent through Microsoft
Connect, a site that’s being used by more and more product teams. That can seem
like a black hole, because in many cases Microsoft can’t tell you what
they’re doing with your feedback until they’ve shipped the next version of
the product.

The Windows PowerShell team does indeed read that stuff, though. In fact,
there’s a whole mess of improvements in version 3 that came directly from
suggestions on Connect.
